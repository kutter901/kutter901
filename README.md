## Hi there 👋

🧠 Neuroscience | 🧬 Bioinformatics | 🖥️ Computational Modeling

Welcome to my GitHub! I work at the intersection of neuroscience, bioinformatics, and computational modeling. My research focuses on spatial transcriptomics, ion dynamics in neuronal excitability, and bulk RNA-seq analysis.

🔬 Current Projects:
Spatial Transcriptomics – Developing pipelines for data processing and analysis.

Ion Dynamics in Seizures – Simulating pathofunctionality in neurons using NetLogo.

Bulk RNA-Seq Analysis – Differential expression analysis, clustering, and visualization.

⚙️ Skills & Tools:
Programming: Bash, R, Python, NetLogo

Bioinformatics: RNA-Seq (DESeq2, Subread), CIBERSORTx, PCA/Clustering, Random Forests

Neuroscience Methods: MEA, electrophysiology, spatial transcriptomics, RNAseq
